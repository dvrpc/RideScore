# RideScore

RideScore is an on-line database that assesses the physical and demographic characteristics around transit stations that relate to how supportive of bicycling the area is, or could be. The database focuses on commuter rail stations outside of Center City Philadelphia as well as trolley and subway terminals where having direct, safe, and nonmotorized access between transit stations and a person's origin and/or destination is a challenge.

To assess this relationship, DVRPC staff collected data on various station area characteristics that are likely to be factors in the transit-bicycle connection. The sum of those factors is calculated to give each station a total RideScore. Together, these individual factors, and a station's total RideScore, will give transit agencies, trail advocacy groups and municipalities a picture of the station area characteristics that contribute to demand for bicycle facilities and amenities. Ultimately, RideScore may help communities identify and prioritize improvements designed to strengthen bicycle and transit connectivity.
